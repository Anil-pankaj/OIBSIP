                   <p>
                    This is one of the oldest student blogs and the oldest student newspaper in Europe and other countries.
                    The Student Newspaper doesn’t particularly publish posts about student’s life or much about college.
                    It simply aims to keep students informed by bringing them updates on the latest news from far and near. However,
                    most of the information published is about happenings in the UK and other countries also.
